# Earth Connections MVP

Earth Connections is an educational and interactive web app that explores the interconnections between wildfires, deforestation, and polar ice melting, based on data from NASA’s Earth-observing satellites. The platform demonstrates how changes in one system (such as CO2 levels from wildfires) can alter other Earth systems, providing users with an interactive way to learn about our planet’s climate and environmental changes.
